						<h2>Concept</h2>

						<p>To immerse the viewer in a self-reflective state of both calmness and chaos through Kinect motion tracking visualizations.</p>

						<h2>Experience</h2>
						<p>The installation space will consist of three walls creating an open room. Two white side walls and one main wall with a video projection captured by a Kinect pointed into the room.</p>
						<p>The viewer will see a projection of themselves on the main wall in the installation room.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>The viewer's body will be animated using a particle system. There will be no defining lines for the body but the particles will stay in form based on different parameters.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>If the viewer stands in a relaxed state, the particles will flow slowly and peacefully, staying well within the boundaries of the viewer's body form.</p>
						<p>As the viewer moves and the body is stretched, particles will speed up and begin to move outside of the viewer's form, blurring the lines of the body.</p>

						<h2>Stretch Ideas For Project</h2>
						<p>These ideas may be added to the final project if the original idea is complete and proven working/effective.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Atmospheric Hardware</h2>
						<p>Two side walls will be draped in white sheets. One arduino on each wall will have custom components under the sheets with servos to move the sheets in a flowing motion.</p>
						<p>The speed of the servos will be determined by the same input as the particle system in the projection.</p>
						<p>Foil or any other material may be added behind the white sheet, out of view, to add to the noise.</p>
